I have opened the repo and started my log!
Instead of doing scanner.nextLine() you did scanner.cheese, and also instead of a try catch block you did a try cheese block
I added a new markdown file, wrote a summary, found the commit with the cheese error, and then reverted that commit

I added a new md file, found where the cheese error was, reverted that error, stashed the changes, tagged that commit, found hidden password, then ssh'd into the pi, and then got the output drawing of whatever that is
